# HelloFOSS-Bash


We've all faced the frustations of carrying out routine work :

1. Downloading Course Material
2. Segregating Course Material to folders (to ease preparation before exams!)
3. Cleansing your Webmail of Spam (so that you don't miss out the important stuff!)
4. Typing passwords and 3+ commands to push-pull from Github (especially when you're on a deadline for an assignment!

Even if you are the gawd of patience and any routine work is child's play for you (or you're the type of person, who actually considers these things to be fun!).

Even then you can't deny that privacy is something you don't give a damn about. We're not talking about Privacy in the 'Big Tech' sense, but rather in the 'small  household' sense.

You may have had numerous cases where some of your siblings would've tried to spy on your PC for stuff, by sneakingly getting the password.

Well, there are so many problems we face in online semester and in general.

and charity starts at home, we need to proliferate our attempts towards Social Good within Insti, before we can go for something in the outside world.

You may get an idea about Bash's syntax from [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/bash), [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/shell_scripting.htm) or [here](https://www.shellscript.sh/).

You should also learn about some of the most used features of Bash like [Sed](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html), [Awk](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) and [Grep](https://ostechnix.com/the-grep-command-tutorial-with-examples-for-beginners/).

There would also be small commands you could learn more about along the way, but it would be great to know a good chunk of commands from among [these](https://devhints.io/bash).

Enjoy Solving Insti's Problems!

Coders, Together, Strong!
