Cleaning while at the same time searching for something useful is frustrating, even more so, when you don't know what you're looking for!

Helping people automate this process would be a big help for everyone!

You would need to learn more about [curl](https://curl.se/docs/) to do this, alongwith ```grep```.

You would also need a list of words to signify spam messages, as you definitely won't be making a ML-based Spam filter, but simply disregard the mails with a high number of particular words.

```sed``` and ```awk``` would prove to be instrumental for this type of work.


Happy Coding!
